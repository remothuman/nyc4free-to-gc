converts nyc 4 free events calendar api to a google calendar that people can subscribe to

i used ai vibe-coding to help with making this.

------

Todo:
- still need to set up automatic running of the script to keep it in sync

Todo ideas:
- make a frontend landing webpage linking to how to add calendar 
(or make personal indie website page with this + other sources)
- multiple calendar, one with all day events as just first and last date, one normal (or just do that for events longer than a month)
    - &/or multiple calendars for event types if possible
