Todo ideas:
- make a frontend landing webpage linking to how to add calendar 
(or make personal indie website page with this + other sources)
- multiple calendar, one with all day events as just first and last date, one normal (or just do that for events longer than a month)
    - &/or multiple calendars for event types if possible 
- ideally it would not delete events briefly during the update period, instead modifying the events in place
