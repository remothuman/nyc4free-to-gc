converts nyc 4 free events calendar api to a google calendar that people can subscribe to

i used ai vibe-coding to help with making this.

------



Todo ideas:
- multiple calendar, one with all day events as just first and last date, one normal (or just do that for events longer than a month)
    - &/or multiple calendars for event types if possible 
- make a frontend landing webpage linking to how to add calendar 
(make personal website page with this, luma, and other sources)

- add option to not delete old events when we do a refresh
